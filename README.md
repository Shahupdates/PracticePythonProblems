# Practice Python Problems

Welcome to the Practice Python Problems repository! This repository is dedicated to providing a collection of Python problems suitable for beginners or those looking to improve their Python skills. The problems included here range from being designed to be simpler than even the easiest problems found on platforms like LeetCode, to medium level problems, to hard level problems, and then to problems that even the most advanced leetcoder would have to think twice when completing.

## How to Use the Repository

### File Structure

The repository is organized into different difficulty levels: easy, medium, hard, and extreme. Each difficulty level has a corresponding folder containing the Python problem files.

- `easy`: Contains easy-level Python problem files.
- `medium`: Contains medium-level Python problem files.
- `hard`: Contains hard-level Python problem files.
- `extreme`: Contains extreme-level Python problem files.

### Running the Flask Application

The `app.py` file in the root directory of the repository contains a Flask application that serves the problem files and an index.html file. The problem files can be accessed through the URL route `/difficulty/problem<number>.py`, where `difficulty` is one of the difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard, extreme), and `number` is the problem number.

To run the Flask application, follow these steps:

1. Install Flask if you haven't already. You can install Flask by running `pip install flask` in your terminal.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the repository.

3. Run the following command to start the Flask application: ``` python app.py ```


The Flask application will start running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Accessing the Problem Files

Once the Flask application is running, you can access the problem files by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:5000/difficulty/problem<number>.py`, where `difficulty` is one of the difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard, extreme), and `number` is the problem number.

For example, to access the second problem in the easy difficulty level, you would navigate to `http://localhost:5000/easy/problem2.py`.

### Viewing the Problem List

The `index.html` file in the root directory of the repository contains a table that lists all the problems in the repository. Each problem is represented by a clickable cell in the table.

To view the problem list, open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` (when the Flask application is running).

Clicking on a problem cell will open a popup displaying the code for that problem.
