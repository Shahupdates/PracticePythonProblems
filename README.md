# Practice Python Problems

Welcome to the Practice Python Problems repository! This repository is dedicated to providing a collection of Python problems suitable for beginners or those looking to improve their Python skills. The problems included here range from being designed to be simpler than even the easiest problems found on platforms like LeetCode, to medium level problems, to hard level problems, then to problems even the most advanced leetcoder would have to think twice when completing.

## How to Use

Each problem is organized in its own directory within this repository. Inside each problem directory, you will find a `README.md` file that describes the problem and provides instructions. Additionally, you will find a Python file (`problem.py`) that contains a template for the problem solution. Your task is to complete the solution in the `problem.py` file according to the given instructions.

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command: ``` git clone https://github.com/Shahupdates/PracticePythonProblems ```
2. Navigate to the specific problem directory that you want to work on: ``` cd PracticePythonProblems ```

3. Read the problem description and instructions provided in the `README.md` file.

4. Open the `problem.py` file in your preferred Python editor or IDE.

5. Implement your solution within the designated code area. You can also add additional functions or helper classes as needed.

6. Test your solution using sample inputs provided in the problem description, or create your own test cases to verify its correctness.

7. Once you are satisfied with your solution, you can submit a pull request to the main repository if you would like to contribute your solution or discuss it with others.
